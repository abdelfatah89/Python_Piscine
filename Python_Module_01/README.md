# py01

## Concept
This module focuses on organizing data and composing small utilities around it. The exercises practice clean data handling and lightweight abstractions.

## Goals
- Represent domain data in a readable structure.
- Separate data definition from logic that uses it.
- Build small helpers to compute derived values.

## Key Concepts
- Lists, tuples, and dictionaries
- Simple data modeling
- Helper functions and small factories
- Consistent naming and output formatting

## Inputs and Outputs
- Inputs: small structured datasets or constants.
- Outputs: computed values or short summaries derived from the data.

## Edge Cases
- Missing keys or unexpected types should be handled safely.
- Empty datasets should yield sensible defaults.

## Usage Examples
- Run a module script and inspect printed summaries.
- Adjust the data structure and confirm outputs update.

## Exercises
- [ex0](ex0): introduce the theme with basic output.
- [ex1](ex1): collect and expose structured garden data.
- [ex2](ex2): compute simple growth metrics.
- [ex3](ex3): build a small factory-style helper.
- [ex4](ex4): apply basic security checks or rules.
- [ex5](ex5): model different plant types.
- [ex6](ex6): analyze garden data to produce insights.
