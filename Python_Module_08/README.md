## Concept
This module continues with structured program design. The exercises build on construction patterns and modular code organization.

## Goals
- Design code that is easy to extend.
- Use small components to build larger behavior.
- Keep responsibilities separated across modules.

## Key Concepts
- Construction and builder-style helpers
- Modular organization
- Clear interfaces between components

## Inputs and Outputs
- Inputs: component definitions or configuration values.
- Outputs: constructed objects or composed results.

## Edge Cases
- Missing components should produce clear errors.
- Default configurations should be sensible.

## Usage Examples
- Build a small configuration and verify outputs.
- Add a component and confirm the build still works.

## Exercises
- [ex0](ex0): implement a construction helper or builder.
- [ex1](ex1): extend with additional components.
- [ex2](ex2): extend with additional components.
