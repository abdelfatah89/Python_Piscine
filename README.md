# Piscine Python

## Concept
This workspace is a progression of Python exercises. Each module folder introduces a small set of concepts, and each exercise applies them in a focused script.

## Goals
- Practice core Python syntax and control flow.
- Learn to structure code across multiple files.
- Build confidence with data handling and basic design patterns.

## How To Use
- Open a module folder and read its README for the concept and exercise notes.
- Run scripts from their folder to keep imports consistent.
- Tweak inputs or constants to observe changes in output.

## Modules
- [py00](py00): basic functions, arithmetic, loops, recursion.
- [py01](py01): data organization and small abstractions.
- [py02](py02): exceptions and error handling.
- [py03](py03): small systems and data processing.
- [py04](py04): file and stream handling.
- [py05](py05): data streams and pipelines.
- [py06](py06): imports, modules, and packages.
- [py07](py07): object-oriented design patterns.
- [py08](py08): structured program design.
- [py09](py09): data generation and export.
- [py10](py10): decorators and higher-order functions.
