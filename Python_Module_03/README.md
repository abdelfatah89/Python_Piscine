## Concept
This module explores small systems made of multiple parts. The exercises mix data processing with simple command and state patterns.

## Goals
- Design small components that work together.
- Process structured input into a computed output.
- Track state changes across multiple operations.

## Key Concepts
- Command parsing and dispatch
- Aggregation and analytics
- Coordinate transformations
- State tracking and inventory logic

## Inputs and Outputs
- Inputs: lists, commands, or numeric sets.
- Outputs: summaries, transformed values, or status reports.

## Edge Cases
- Empty input streams should not crash.
- Invalid commands should be rejected safely.
- State should stay consistent after each update.

## Usage Examples
- Provide a small command list and verify the final state.
- Run analytics on a tiny dataset to confirm calculations.

## Exercises
- [ex0](ex0): interpret commands and run actions.
- [ex1](ex1): compute analytics from scores.
- [ex2](ex2): work with coordinates and transformations.
- [ex3](ex3): track achievements and states.
- [ex4](ex4): manage an inventory structure.
- [ex5](ex5): process a data stream.
- [ex6](ex6): display or summarize analytics results.
