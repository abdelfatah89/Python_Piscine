# py00

## Concept
This module introduces core Python building blocks with short, focused scripts. The exercises build confidence with variables, arithmetic, loops, and recursion.

## Goals
- Write simple functions that return values or print results.
- Use conditionals and loops to control flow.
- Compare iterative and recursive approaches for the same task.

## Key Concepts
- Variables, basic types, and arithmetic
- `if`/`elif`/`else` branching
- `for`/`while` loops
- Simple recursion and base cases

## Inputs and Outputs
- Inputs: constants, small lists, or minimal parameters passed to functions.
- Outputs: numeric results or short text messages.

## Edge Cases
- Empty lists or missing values should not crash the script.
- Zero or negative values should be handled consistently.
- Recursion must stop on a clear base case.

## Usage Examples
- Run a script from its folder: `python script_name.py`.
- Use a small input set and inspect printed output.

## Exercises
- [ex0](ex0): print a greeting with a minimal function.
- [ex1](ex1): compute a simple area value from small inputs.
- [ex2](ex2): total a list of numeric values.
- [ex3](ex3): compute an age or offset from input data.
- [ex4](ex4): produce a reminder based on conditions.
- [ex5](ex5): compare iterative vs recursive counting.
- [ex6](ex6): summarize multiple values into a short report.
- [ex7](ex7): manage a small inventory list.
